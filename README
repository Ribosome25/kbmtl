This repository contains Matlab and R implementations of the algorithms proposed in "Drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs using kernelized Bayesian multitask learning", which is appearing in Bioinformatics.

demo_classification.m file shows how to use the classification algorithm in Matlab.
demo_classification.R file shows how to use the classification algorithm in R.
demo_regression.m file shows how to use the regression algorithm in Matlab.
demo_regression.R file shows how to use the regression algorithm in R.
